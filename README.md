# CCFUtils
Some Cloud Command Framework utilities that I commonly need. Feel free to use this in your own projects.
### Usage
Usage with Gradle:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven { url = "https://www.jitpack.io" }
}
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.Elephant1214:CCFUtils:main-SNAPSHOT")
}
```
It is highly recommended that you relocate CCFUtils to your own package to stop conflicts.
